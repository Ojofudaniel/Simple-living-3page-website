                     that I loved, but the truth was I  couldn't even appreciate
                     any of it because there was too much.

                <p class="article-body">
                    Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I
                     didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

                    I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, 
                    sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.

                    It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, 
                    I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

                    Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed,
                     enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
